Go and Cloud Native Programming Languages:

After watching the video, definitely I would like to make a case to add "Go/GoLang"  to the list of approved programming languages. I would like to outline below points from video to support my case.

Go is a compiled, concurrent, garbage-collected, statically typed language developed at Google. Go is efficient, scalable, and productive programming language. Go was designed to address the problems faced in software development at Google. Go improves the working environment for its designers and developers. This makes it excellent tool for engineering large software projects.

Go gets directly compiled from binary file that makes its fast build times that enable iterative development, lower memory and CPU utilization. 
Memory management has a profound effect on the way a language works in practice, Golang's automatic garbage collection is another reason that makes it faster as compared to other programming language, with proper memory management.

Servers built with Go gets instant start up times and are cheaper to run in pay-as-you-go and serverless deployments.
Go has a strong ecosystem supporting service development. The design of Go's package system combines some of the properties of libraries, name spaces, and modules into a single construct. The standard library includes packages for common needs like HTTP servers and clients, JSON/XML parsing, SQL databases, and a range of security/encryption functionality. Its wide use in server and cloud environments, its speed and ease of use, and its evident capabilities for data analysis, have made it a prime choice for developers who need to think about security.

Go’s popularity is that the language is backward-compatible, meaning all applications written in earlier versions of Golang will stay stable after updates. That makes a powerful point in support of Go. Going serverless will only become increasingly popular, as it can provide companies flexibility, access to virtually unlimited resources, and most importantly, much lower costs than with in-house servers. Golang, can reduce the load on your servers or the amount of resources.

Concurrency is important to the modern computing environment with its multicore machines running web servers with multiple clients. This multithreading and concurrency are not properly supported in other programming languages. Go enables simple, safe concurrent programming, with no indexing and pointers like other programming languages.


Thanks to the language being highly efficient and therefore easy on memory and CPU. Either way, organization using it  will see a visible difference in  server costs.
I’m excited to continue to learn Golang, it seems like a fun tool to use and write. I’m looking forward to testing some more code with Go and is excited to educate the team about how powerful Go is so as to get added in the approved list of languages.
