After watching video, definitely I would like to make a case to add "Go/GoLang"  to the list of approved programming languages. To support my case, I will outline below points from video:

Golang, also known as Go, is productive, scalable, and productive programming language in software industry. Go was designed to address the issues for while development of softwares at Google. Go makes the development environment efficient for its designers and developers. This makes it excellent tool for software engineering of large software projects. The language was designed for people who write, develop and maintain the large software applications.

Go is a compiled, concurrent, garbag -collected, statically typed language developed at Google. Go gets directly compiled from binary files that makes add to its fast build times tenabling iterative development. Memory management has a intense effect on the way a language works in proactical.  In Go  progrraming the unused dependencies are a compile time error (not a warning, an error). If the source code imports a package that is not used, the program will not compile. This guarantees by construction that the dependency tree for any Go program is accurate. This also ensures that no extra code will be compiled while building the program, which minimizes compilation time. Golang's automatic garbage collection it ensures that unused objects no more occupy memory. This is another reason GoLang makes it faster as compared to other programming language, with proper memory management.

Servers built with GoLang have immediate start up time and are cheaper to run in pay-as-you-go and serverless deployments.
Go has a strong ecosystem for application development in software industry. The design of Go's package system combines some of the properties of libraries, name spaces and modules into a single construct. The standard library includes packages for common needs like HTTP servers and clients, JSON/XML parsing, SQL databases, and a range of security/encryption functionality. Its wide use in server and cloud environments, its speed and simplicity of use, and its noticeable capabilities for data analysis, have made it a prime choice for developers.

Goâ€™s popularity is that the language is backward-compatible, that means applications written in earlier versions of Golang will stay stable even after updates. This adds key strength to the Go. Golang, have capability to reduce the load on application servers or most amount of resources, reducing the bottlenecks, enhancing resource utilization. This makes application execution with good performance. 

Concurrency is important to the modern software and computing systems with its multicore machines running web servers with multiple clients. This multithreading and concurrency are not properly supported in other programming languages. Go enables simple, safe concurrent programming, with no indexing and pointers like other programming languages.

Thanks to the programming language being highly efficient and easy on memory and CPU utilization. Either way, organization using it will see a visible difference in server costs, efficiency and ease of use.
I am excited to continue my journey to learn Golang. I am looking forward to do testing and POC on some more code with Go including data engineering with Go. I am also excited to educate my team about how powerful Go is so as to get added in the approved list of languages.
